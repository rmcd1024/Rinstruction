This repository will store items useful in teaching R.

* [`install_packages.Rmd`](install.packages.Rmd) You can distribute
  this as a markdown file.  You specify package names in the `pkgs`
  variable. You have others compile the file in RStudio (for example),
  and it will install the packages you have specified if they do not
  exist on the user's machine. This does *not* allow version checking
  or anything sophisticated. Warnings for uninstalled packages should
  be printed at the top of the document.

* [`R-four-ways`](r-four-ways.html) This compares and benchmarks
  different methods of accomplishing the same calculations.^[The file
  contains examples of accessing a password-protected PostgreSQL
	  server. The username and password are not public]
